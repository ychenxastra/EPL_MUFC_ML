# Analyses of Football Matches and Predicting Results Using Machine Learning
This is a Jupyter Notebook (Python 3) for analyzing data of English Premier League (EPL) and Manchester United Football Club (MUFC or Man United) from Season 2000-2001 to 2022-2023. 

## Sections
- Load data
- Preprocessing data: handling the original data list (missing values, NaNs, incorrect records, dropping data, etc.)
- Visualize data: dataframe at a glance (statistical values, team performances, etc.)
- Processing data: preparing data for machine learning
- Train using different models: Random Forest, XGBBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
- Can we improve accuracy: adopting 5-fold 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV, rolling average, feature selection, and principle component analysis (PCA)
- Prediction for Man United: similiar procedure for MUFC data
- Summary and Discussion: including my own thoughts and future works
